      <description>Overview I came back from the gym last week and a few of my friend&amp;rsquo;s made the following claim:
 Following the first link of a Wikipedia article always leads to philosophy.
 It was a very strong claim, but one that can be verified easily.
Solution My previous scraping projects and linksearchers have been exclusively in Python. I love Python, but I have been exposed to Ruby over the past months and decided this project would be a good fit. 5 months ago I made Seguridad to learn how to make a Ruby gem and increase my exposure to the language.</description>

Problem Given a website URL, search the website for all external and internal links. Follow all internal links while not revisiting past links.
