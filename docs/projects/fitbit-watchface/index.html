  <h1 id="making-a-fitbit-watchface">making a fitbit watchface</h1>
<p>disclaimer: this is a dev log, not polished.</p>
<h2 id="why">why</h2>
<p>I was reading <code>Master of Doom</code> about ID Software and the legends John Romen and John Carmack.
The author describes the game-making process and how new engine technology designed
by Carmack enabled new games designed by Romero. This made me think about my
meager experience in graphics, and UI in general.</p>
<p>I mostly work on backend and infrastructure and wanted to do a toy project.
Somehow, I realized that the clockface for my fitbit watch could be a fun thing to do.
Pomodoros have also been the talk of the town on Toronto tech twitter, so I wanted
to use that to get more done.</p>
<p>Thus began my journey to make a custom clockface for my fitbit.</p>
<h2 id="dev-notes">dev notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Getting the necessary tools up on linux was fine. The only issue that the fitbit simulator
only works on windows and osx. I am debugging against my actual fitbit sense which is actually not too bad</li>
<li>to debug against your actual device, you have to connect the fitbit to wifi</li>
<li>then, when you when <code>npx fitbit</code>, running <code>bi</code> will build and install the
custom clockface on your device</li>
<li>all of my UI elements leverage hardcoded x and y percentages for the elements in html.
this is crude but also easy to debug and tweak. I know minimal css and html,
flexbox was the extent of my alignment knowledge</li>
<li>I like the idea of a graphic that changes as the day progresses
<ul>
<li>instead of having a sprite move across the cityscape, make the city more dynamic and
take up the full screen? Have the sprite move along a path that changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use colours to indicate progress on the different metrics (eg. reg when my bpm is high)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iterations">iterations</h2>
<h3 id="iteration-1">iteration 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to get a background image + the time on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fitbit-iteration-1" src="/images/fitbit/0.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="iteration-2">iteration 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>started computing different metrics I care about. The 4 I converged on were
<ul>
<li>time</li>
<li>bpm</li>
<li>calories/ calorie goal</li>
<li>steps / step goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fitbit-iteration-2" src="/images/fitbit/1.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="iteration-3">iteration 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>I wanted a cooler color scheme with a background image. Went with a BW image of a cityscape.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fitbit-iteration-3" src="/images/fitbit/2.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="iteration-4">iteration 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>I also added htop like progress bars for the different stats. Fitbit does not have
monospace fonts which makes it painful to align the bars</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fitbit-iteration-4" src="/images/fitbit/3.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="iteration-5">iteration 5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Swapped the cityscape image</li>
<li>To fix the alignment issue, I used svg lines instead of text. This made it easier to align
the progress bars</li>
<li>I also added an sprite image of a motorcycle dude that moves across the screen
based on the time. thanks midjourney</li>
</ul>
