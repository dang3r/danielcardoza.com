      <description>Overview Bitcoin Prices 2020 The price of Bitcoin is encroaching upon it&amp;rsquo;s all time high of 20000 USD. In the last month, it has increased by 33%! I was curious to see how much you could have made by dollar cost averaging bitcoin. Luckily, with a little help from Yahoo Finance and Pandas this is easily done.
How? Yahoo Finance has a webpage exposing historical data for Bitcoin and other currencies.</description>

      <description>TL:DR pip install clickupy / https://github.com/dang3r/clickupy
Over the past few years, I have used many different project management tools. JIRA has been a consistent one, and the tool with the most name recognition. Trello is a very lightweight alternative, and the the one I personally use. Redbooth is another big player and I&amp;rsquo;ve used it heavily (especially while working there!). Wrike and Asana are a few others I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered every now and then.</description>
