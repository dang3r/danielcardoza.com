      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/jotw-game.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Jewels of the Oracle 1995&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the games my parents used to play in the 1990s was Jewels of the Oracle.&#xA;It is a puzzle game set in ancient Mesopotamia consisting of 24 puzzles. They range from logical, geometric&#xA;and lingustic puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mother was really interested in playing it again. The game came out in 1995, so playing it&#xA;on modern hardware is difficult. We searched for various methods that were dead ends. It would not run properly&#xA;on the software DOSBox used for running old games. Trying to play it on a Windows 7 machine via compatibility&#xA;mode also failed. The last idea I had was to try and run it within a Virtual Machine. I eventually got it&#xA;to work, and have left the installation details below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
