# Overview

Regular expressions (regex) are a fun topic in computer science. I love revisiting the fundamentals
every so often, so I read https://qntm.org/re_en recently. It is a great practical
primer on regex. I'd recommend it to beginners and advanced engineers alike. 

# Backreferences

One of the most powerful regex techniques are [backreferences](https://www.regular-expressions.info/backref.html).
They allow you to match text that was previously matched by a capture group. You refer
to previous groups using their index.

### Example

Let's assume you want to match the strings `aa`, `bb` or `cc`. A sufficient expression is
`^(aa|bb|cc)$`. The equivalent using a back expression is `^([a-c])\1$`. The text from the group `([a-c])` is referenced
by the 1th capture group using `\1`.

The zeroth capture group is the entire string, which is why the `1th` is used. You can use backreferences to different capture groups
in the same regex (`\1`, `\2`, etc).

# Directed Acylic Graph

A directed acylic graph (DAG) has the following properties:

- all edges are directed
- no cycles are present in the graph (you cannot start at a node `n` and find a path back to `n`)

When you have a DAG, you can define a [topological ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) 
of its vertices. It is a list of vertices such that for every
edge in the graph `a -> b`,  the node `a` comes before node `b` in the graph.

![Topological Sort](https://tutorialhorizon.com/static/media/algorithms/2018/03/Topological-Sort.png)

A classic graph theory problem is finding a path between two nodes. Using what we know about backreferences and DAGs,
we can try and solve this using regular expressions.

# Problem

### Given a DAG, find a path between two nodes using a regular expression(s).

### Encoding 
Graphs are typically represented using a 2D matrix or adjacency lists. Regular expressions
operate on strings. To encode a graph to a string, first get a topological ordering
of the vertices in the graph. For the graph above, one such ordering is is `a b c f j x y z`.

Next, join each vertex with a string containing each vertex it has an edge to. For our graph, this is
`abcf bh cj fj jxy x yz z`.

Now that we encoded the graph into a string, we can use regular expressions to try and extract a path
from it. 

### Using Regex to extract a path

To find a path from `a` to `j`, one of `a`'s edges must be used (`bcf`). Then, for the first edge chosen,
that must also have an edge leading to another vertext which leads to `z`. We can represent this idea
in regex. Assuming the length of the path is 2, we can use `a\w*(\w).*\s\1\w*j$`.

Let's digest this:

- `a` : We start with our first vertex
- `\w*(\w)` : We match a single vertex that `a` has an edge to. 
- `.*\s\1` : We scan the rest of the string until we find whitespace followed by  the previous vertex (`\1`).
- `\w*j` : Ensure that the vertex has `j` has a neighbour.

The encoding of the string is important. If the vertices were not topolgically sorted, we may not have found a path.
The regex looks forward for the next vertex to continue the path. If that it wasn't forward but behind, this would not work. 
The encoding `cj fj abcf bh  jxy x yz z` would not let us find a path from `a -> j` because `cj` and `fj` are behind it.

To extend, for paths of our lengths, we continually add sections of `\w*(\w).*\s\1` where `\1` changes to represent whatever the previous
matching group index is.

The exact length of a matching path may not be known. My current solution generates regular expressions
of lengths `[1, #  of verticies]` and tries to find a match in any. However, I am sure you could generate one monster expression instead.

My current solution to the problem can be seen at https://gist.github.com/dang3r/f2434de0a167ecfb0b90f48be7d6df67

# Why?

I would never suggest using this in any production setitng. However, it was a fun problem and helped
me dive deeper into regex and a bit of graph theory. Learning through problem solving is my most effective way to learn.
