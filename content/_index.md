# hello internet traveller

This is my blog with tech and other musings. The theme of this blog changes
more often than the content. Maybe this theme will change that :)

Some errata:

- Living in TO
- Working for üêá.ai on pushing the sota for medical imaging AI
- Former competitive fps pcgamer
- Avid lifter, hiker and public bikeshare rider
- The only blog post I like is [this one on regex +tsort](http://danielcardoza.com/regex-pathfinding/)
- Currently working on:
  - A custom clockface for my fitbit
  - Using style-transfer to generate wall-art for our apartment
  - DICOM, HL7, medical-imaging, productizing AI and regulatory plumbing
  - Meeting passionate and cool people in TO (dm me on [twitter](https://x.com/_dcardoza))
  - Using the pomodoro technique to get more done
- Currently reading:
  - Masters of Doom (epic tale of ID software and the two Johns)
  - John Prophet (retro comic series)
  - Tokyo Ghost (epic cyberpunk comic series)
